//Session 4
Installation and frist react app:
 To install any library of JS, we use pacakage managers. these package managers are used to install/uninstall/update the packages.npm is the popular package manager. to have npm you need to download and install nodejs.
   step1: go to this website: https://nodejs.org/en/download
   step2: dowload as per your OS(windows or mac or linux)
   step3: install by double tap and select "npm package  manager" and "yes".
   step4: verify by going to cmd,and type "node -v".it prints version of node if it is installed else error.

    You need to have a code editor,we prefer "vs code " in this course.
    for nice folder, install "material icon theme"  by pkief in VS code.
    for shortcuts install "ES7 react/redux..." by rodrigovallades
    basic settings --> goto file-->activate autosave.


    create a folder and open in vscode and open terminal-->new terminal-->cd folder name

    "npm create vite@latest"

    vite is a template code which will create template code for different JS frameworks/libraries
    After the command give project name, pacakge name and select recat.
    -->cd foldername
    -->npm install
    -->npm run dev

it will run recat app in local host : 5173, to change the default code, goto src-->app.jsx and write html code between return.

To  build the application, run the command "npm run build"
it will create a dist folder which contains HTML,CSS,JS. 
Browsers cannot understand react directly so "babel" converts react code to browser understandable JS.

goto site configuration -->change site name
