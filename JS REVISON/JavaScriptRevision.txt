JAVASCRIPT REVISION:

1)Difference between var,let and const:
var is a function scoped variable and it can be redecared, reassignmed and also it is possible to access var before declaration

let and const are block scoped variables and they cannot be redeclared or access before declaration
let can reassign but const can'they

2)Arrays(map,filter,forEach)
   map,filter and forEach all will iterate through the whole array and pass a callback function.
   callback function contains two paramenters( value an dindex)
   Difference between forEach and map is 
    forEach cannot return the value and map can return the values
    Difference between map and filter is map will return all values but filter returns values where return condition is true.

3)logical and , logical or and ternary operators

logical and expects all conditions to be true
logical or expects any one condition to be true
ternary operator checks the condition and if condition is true it executes first block else second block

4) normal functions and arrow functions
  Arrow functions uses modern syntax with prebuilt return with single statements
     
     rest and spread operator
     both operators uses three dots to represent but rest is considerd  when receiving the values, and 
     it combines all values into an array and 
     spread is considerd when giving the values and 
     it seperates all the array values into individual elements

5)promise,fetch,async await:
       promise: promise is an object returned by asyncronous operation(it takes time). 
       every promise will have 3 states i.e., fulfilled, rejected, pending

       we can resolve a promise using then and catch block,if promise is fulfilled, it will go to then block
       else it will go to catch block.
          promise
          .then(callback)
          .catch(callback)
