React forms can be done in 2 ways. based on forms, reac components are divided as
1)controlled components
2)uncontrolled components

in controlled components,forms input values are contolled by state.
we can save or manipulate the input values using state 
we can use events such as oninput, onchange,onclick, onselect,onsubmit


detailed explanation of both controlles and uncontrolled
1. Controlled components:
   -Form input values are controlled nby react state
   -Any changes to the input values are reflected in the state
   -Developers have full control over the form inputs and can validate and manipulate the data
   -Requires more code to setup the initial state and handle changes

2. Uncontrolled components:
   -form inout values are managed by DOM
   -React does not have direct control over the input values
   -Developers c an still access the current values using ref
   -Requires less code to setup, but it is more difficult to validate and manipulate the data
