components are the basic building blocks of User Interafce. it is used for reusability.
Whole UI is divided into small logical parts called components
There are 2 types of components in react
i.functional components
ii.class components

i.functional components:
 These components uses a function to render UI. every function will return a JSX element
 which will render UI. react follows JSX structure. every component need to be exported

 eg: function ComponentName(){
  return{
    //JSX
  }
 }
 export default ComponentName;


 A Component inside another component is called nested  component. The components
 which conatins another component is called parent component and the component which 
 is inside another component is called child component.

 props: it is short of 'Properties' in react and are used to pass data from parent component to child component.
 These are immutable values from parent component to child component.

 How to pass props?
  to pass props you can add attributes to components when they are used in parent JSX

  //parent.jsx
function parent(){
  return(
    <div>
        <Child name="boruto" />
    </div>
  )
}

How to use props?
  props can be used or received by child component as an object of function parameters

  //child.jsx
  function Child(){
    return(
      <p>{props.name}</p>
    )
  }

  Destructuring props:
  we can even Destructure the values inside the props using object Destructuring
  //Child.jsx
  function Child({name}){
    return(
      <p>{name}</p>
    )
  }

  How to send props from child to parent ?
  In React it is not possible to send the data from child to parent directly, because in react data is always one way data binding
  but There is an indirect way. parent can even send functions as props, so the parent sends function as props and child will send the value to parent 
  
  //parent.jsx
  function Parent(){
    function add(a,b){
      console.log("the sum of a and b is "+ (a+b))
    }
    return(
      <Child add={add} />
    )
  }

  //child.jsx

  function Child(props){
    return(
      <button onClick={()=>props.add(2,3)}> click me </button>
    )
  }

  state : state defines the value that changes, for eg: one buttonis in red color-- this is one state , and that changes to blue-- this is the changed state. to managhe states react has multiple approches.

  -->class components can use state objects directly, that is why these components are also called as statefull components
  -->functional components can use state object using "useState" hook. A hook is a function that starts with "use" and it replaces basic functionlities in react.
      Before react 16 , functional components do not used to have state objevct implementation , so they used to be called as stateless components


 Definition  : state is a object that defines/stores the data that changes over time in a component. Everytime the state changes the component rerenders with new data
