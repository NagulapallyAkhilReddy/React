we can define components in 2 ways 
functional and class components 
functional components are also called stateless components as they do not have the state object by default, it can have state using useState hook from react 26 onwards
class components are called statefull components as they have state object by default
eg:
class MyComponent etxtends Component
{

  render(){
    return(
      <div>

      </div>
    )
  }

}

counter using class Component
