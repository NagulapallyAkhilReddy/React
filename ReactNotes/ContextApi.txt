Propdrilling: In recat, there is a situtaion where we have to pass the props form a componnet to the innermost child of that componnet, 
while doing so we would have to pass the props to the components inbetween too, which doesn't have anything to do with that props.
-- this is called as Propdrilling

We solve propdrilling by using contextApi
The contextApi allows us to share the data between the components wihout manually passing them, 
it provides a way to manage global state, making it easirt to access/update the data across application

  -->Context : A context is a object that holds the shared data
  -->Provider : A provider is a  component that wraps around your app and provides context to components
  -->Consumer : A consumer is a componet that uses the context
