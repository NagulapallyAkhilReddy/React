routing is used to navigate between differnet pages.
React cannot do routing by default, so we need a library for routing in react, the standard
library for routing in reatc is "React Router DOM".

step1: go to terminal -->cd-specific project -->npm install react-router-dom

react router dom contains so many values and functions to use them, application should be 
inside browserrouter

step@: goto main.jsx import BrowserRouter, and keep App inside BrowserRouter

step3: goto app.jsx , define routes and each route as follows. Before that create components for different pages

<Routes>
 <Route path="/path" component={componentName}/>
</Routes>

step4: Goto Header, define Link to navigate to specific path(anchor tags will reload the page)

 <Link to="path">click here<Link>


Dyanmic Routing
  for dynamic routing, we can mention the path as 
  <Route path='/path/:id' component={componentName}
  here id is a variable, to get what is id in url, we canuse the useParams  hook
  const {id}=useParams();

404 Page:
  for 404 or not found pages, we can mention path as 
  <Route path="*" component={componentName} />
