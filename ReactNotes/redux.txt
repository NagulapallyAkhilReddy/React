Redux: Redux is a state management library.it is used to manage states globally

Even Context API will serve similar purpose, but mostly context API used for smaller states,
it is not suitable for large scale and complex applications

Redux is suitable for large scale and complex applications.
 Redux Architecture:
  To understand how redux works , first understand terminologies
  i.store:There will be always only one store per application in redux.
  store is used to staore all the state values, it is accessable to all components

  ii:Reducer: store state values cannot be changed directly. reducer is a function that contains
  all the rules to replace the state values in the store.

  iii: Actions : Actions are used to trigger Reducer.so that based on action, reducer will change the state in redux

  iv: components: components contain UI. user triggers an event in component which will dispatch actions.


  steps to use Redux:
  i.install redux,npm install redux react-redux
  ii.create a folder redux and files action.js, reducer.js, store.js

  //Action.js
